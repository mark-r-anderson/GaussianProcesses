# Gaussian Processes
## Notes
This is a basic Gaussian process implementation that I made as part of my engineering physics undergraduate thesis with the intention of obtaining a better understanding of Gaussian processes and the theory behind the approach. This portion of the code is general and can be used for numerous regression problems. At some point, I will also upload the code that was specific to my thesis topic (titled *Applications of Gaussian Processes to the Robot Arm Problem*).  

I've decided to make this portion of the code public. I've cleaned it up a bit and done some restructuring since the conclusion of my thesis, but there is more work and cleaning up that needs to be done.

## Theory
At some point, I may quickly outline the theory behind Gaussian processes here. There are also many useful resources available online. See, for example, *Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning* by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams (http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/).
