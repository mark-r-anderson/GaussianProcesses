# Gaussian Processes
## Notes
This is a basic Gaussian process implementation that I made as part of my engineering physics undergraduate thesis with the intention of obtaining a better understanding of Gaussian processes and the theory behind the approach. This portion of the code is general and can be used for numerous regression problems. At some point, I will also upload the code that was specific to my thesis topic (titled *Applications of Gaussian Processes to the Robot Arm Problem*).  

I've decided to make this portion of the code public. I've cleaned it up a bit and done some restructuring since the conclusion of my thesis, but there is more work and cleaning up that needs to be done.

Please note that this code is primarily intended to put theory into practice and is quite slow for classification. When written, it was meant as more of an exercise for learning rather than something that might be used in practice. There are numerous approximations that can be made to substantially reduce run time.

## Theory
I may outline the theory behind Gaussian processes in the Wiki. However, there are also many useful resources available online. See, for example, *Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning* by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams (http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/).
